# PixelPainter2
NEW version of PixelPainter, an application that allows the user to convert any image into a Minecraft-Painting-Style image with any block dimensions. Intended for use with server plugins that allow maps to be converted into images, such as ImageMaps or ImageFrame.

Converted images appear to be made up of 16x16 pixel blocks to match Minecraft's default painting resolution, but are in fact in a 128x128 pixel resolution to fit minecraft map pixel dimensions. Some plugins don't account for this difference, which is why I included it.
